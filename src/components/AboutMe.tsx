            <p>Hi! I&apos;m a full-stack developer who&apos;s obsessed with crafting smooth, responsive, and accessible web experiences—especially on eCommerce platforms like Shopify Plus and Magento. I lean heavily toward the frontend (because let&apos;s be honest, that&apos;s where the magic happens), but I&apos;m no stranger to backend work when it&apos;s time to hook things up and make it all actually work.</p>

            <p>Over the past 3.5+ years, I&apos;ve launched everything from dynamic product pages to custom pricing tools and promo campaigns. At Rightpoint, I&apos;ve teamed up with designers, marketers, and backend devs to build features that boost conversion rates, improve UX, and just generally make sites better.</p>

            <p>I love turning Figma files into reality, tackling weird edge cases, and pushing pixels with purpose. Whether it&apos;s building ADA-compliant UI, migrating to Shopify 2.0, or tuning performance for SEO—I&apos;m all about creating sites that feel good to use and actually deliver results.</p>

            <p>If you&apos;re into creative dev, clean code, and projects that live at the intersection of tech, design, and user experience, let&apos;s chat!</p>
