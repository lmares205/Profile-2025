            <p>Hi! I'm a full-stack developer who's obsessed with crafting smooth, responsive, and accessible web experiences—especially on eCommerce platforms like Shopify Plus and Magento. I lean heavily toward the frontend (because let's be honest, that's where the magic happens), but I'm no stranger to backend work when it's time to hook things up and make it all actually work.</p>

            <p>Over the past 3.5+ years, I've launched everything from dynamic product pages to custom pricing tools and promo campaigns. At Rightpoint, I've teamed up with designers, marketers, and backend devs to build features that boost conversion rates, improve UX, and just generally make sites better.</p>

            <p>I love turning Figma files into reality, tackling weird edge cases, and pushing pixels with purpose. Whether it's building ADA-compliant UI, migrating to Shopify 2.0, or tuning performance for SEO—I'm all about creating sites that feel good to use and actually deliver results.</p>

            <p>If you're into creative dev, clean code, and projects that live at the intersection of tech, design, and user experience, let's chat!</p>
